# GsSqueak

This project emerged from a bachelor's project at the [HPI Software Architechture Group](https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab) in the year 2017/18. It was named "Programmieren direkt in der Datenbank - ..." .

Part of the project was to modify [Squeak/Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/) to be able to import it into the [GemStone/Smalltalk](https://gemtalksystems.com/products/gs64/) ecosystem. The core modifications are necessary to use the GemStone VM instead of the Squeak VM.
