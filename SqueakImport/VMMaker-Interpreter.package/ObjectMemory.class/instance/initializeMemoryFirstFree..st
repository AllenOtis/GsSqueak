initialization
initializeMemoryFirstFree: firstFree 
	"Initialize endOfMemory to the top of oop storage space, reserving some space for forwarding blocks, and create the freeBlock from which space is allocated. Also create a fake free chunk at endOfMemory to act as a sentinal for memory scans. "
	"Note: The amount of space reserved for forwarding blocks should be chosen to ensure that incremental compactions can usually be done in a single pass. However, there should be enough forwarding blocks so a full compaction can be done in a reasonable number of passes, say ten. (A full compaction requires N object-moving passes, where N = number of non-garbage objects / number of forwarding blocks). 
	di 11/18/2000 Re totalObjectCount: Provide a margin of one byte per object to be used for forwarding pointers at GC time. Since fwd blocks are 8 bytes, this means an absolute worst case of 8 passes to compact memory. In most cases it will be adequate to do compaction in a single pass. "
