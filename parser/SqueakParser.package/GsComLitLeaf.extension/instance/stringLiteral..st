stringLiteral: aString
  " aString is a  string literal such as the Smalltalk literal  'abc'  
  that can be completely generated by the Parser.

 It is the responsibility of the parser to maintain a dictionary
 of String literals if it is desired to canonicalize Strings  within
 method compilations, or across method compilations .  All String
 literals will be made invariant by the code generator."
