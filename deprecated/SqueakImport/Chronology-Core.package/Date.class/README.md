Instances of Date are Timespans with duration of 1 day.  As with all Chronology Timespan sub-instances, Dates can be instantiated as position values which compare equally to any other instance of the same Date, irregardless of the timezone in which either is created.

However, like the other Timespan subInstances, there are rare cases where it may be desirable to use instances of Date to represent a particular 1-day span of time at a particular locality on the globe.  All Timespans, including Dates, may specify a particular timezone offset for this purpose.
